# My personal site

I use this site to show off what I am currently working on, and some of my interests.

I don't expect people to set this up and use it for themselves, this is moreso just to show off the website's code and structure.
**Please do not contact me asking for help. If you are unaware what to do with this repo, just use something else.**
